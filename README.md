# CipherSchools - Profile Page and Backend

## How to get the backend running...
Firstly, navigate into the 'api' folder, create a folder by the name of 'vars' and create a file '.env' inside it.
Inside the '.env' file, add the PORT number and the Mongo URL...
```
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI = 'Enter url here...'
```

Thereafter, move to the 'api' folder in the command line and run the commands `npm install` and `npm start`.

## How to get the frontend running...
To run the frontend, navigate into the 'client' folder in your command line and run the commands `npm install` and `npm start`.

The frontend is completely responsive for various screen types. Clicking the top left profile picture settings icon would open up the update model to modify user details.
The number of followers can be seen on the top right corner. Clicking on it will open a model displaying followers details.
